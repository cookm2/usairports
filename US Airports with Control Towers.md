#### US Airports with Control Towers

> Description

This is a choropleth of airport density by state in the United States of America. The "plane" symbol color shows whether or not a particular airport has an air traffic control tower located on the premise. Users can find the name of specific airports by clicking on individual "plane" symbols. 

> Methods and Reasoning

Most of my modifications to this map were aimed at making it more user friendly and geared toward the information that I was trying to display. The zoom level and center position of the map makes it easy to view the main 48 states while also displaying Alaska, Hawaii and other US territories. 

> Data and Sources
